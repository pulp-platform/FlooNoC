This repository provides modules for the FlooNoC, a Network-on-Chip (NoC) which is part of the [PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low Power) Platform](https://pulp-platform.org/). The repository includes Network Interface IPs (named chimneys), Routers and further NoC components to build a complete NoC. FlooNoC mainly supports [AXI4+ATOPs](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi/tree/master), but can be easily extended to other On-Chip protocols. Arbitrary topologies are supported with several routing algorithms. FlooNoC is designed to be scalable and modular, and can be easily extended with new components. Additionally, FlooNoC provides a generation framework for creating customized NoC configurations.

## üí° Design Principles

Our NoC design is grounded in the following key principles:

1. **Full AXI4 Support**: Our design fully supports AXI4+ATOPs from AXI5 as outlined [here](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi/tree/master), particularly multiple outstanding burst transactions. It utilizes low-complexity routers and a decoupled link-level protocol to ensure scalability, thereby enabling tolerance to high-latency off-chip accesses.
1. **Decoupled Links and Networks**: We use a link-level protocol that is decoupled from the network-level protocol. This allows us to move the complexity of the network-level protocol into the network interfaces, while deploying low-complexity routers in the network, that enable better scalability.
1. **Wide Physical Channels**: We incorporate wide physical channels in order to meet the high-bandwidth requirements at network endpoints without being constrained by the operating frequency. This is in contrast to the traditional narrow link approach. Further, the NoC avoids any kind of serialization and sends entire messages in a single flit including header and tail information.
1. **Separation of traffic**: Our design acknowledges the diversity in traffic patterns, as it decouples links and networks to handle wide, high-bandwidth, burst-based traffic and narrow, latency-sensitive traffic with separate physical channels.
1. **Modularity:** Our design principles also emphasize modularity. We have developed a set of IPs that can be instantiated together to build a NoC. This approach not only promotes reusability but also facilitates flexibility in designing custom NoCs to cater to a variety of specific system requirements.

## üîÆ Origin of the name

The names of the IPs are inspired by the [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) universe, where the [Floo Network](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Floo_Network) is a magical transportation system. The Network interfaces are named after the fireplaces and chimneys used to access the Floo Network.

> In use for centuries, the Floo Network, while somewhat uncomfortable, has many advantages. Firstly, unlike broomsticks, the Network can be used without fear of breaking the International Statute of Secrecy. Secondly, unlike Apparition, there is little to no danger of serious injury. Thirdly, it can be used to transport children, the elderly and the infirm."

## ‚≠ê Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

FlooNoC uses [bender](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender) to manage its dependencies and to automatically generate compilation scripts. Further `Python >= 3.10` is required to install the generation framework.

### Simulation
Currently, we do not provide any open-source simulation setup. Internally, the FlooNoC was tested using QuestaSim, which can be launched with the following command:

```sh
# Compile the sources
make compile-sim
# Run the simulation
make run-sim-batch TB_DUT=tb_floo_dut
```

or in the GUI, with prepared waveforms:

```sh
# Compile the sources
make compile-sim
# Run the simulation
make run-sim TB_DUT=tb_floo_dut
```
By replacing `tb_floo_dut` with the name of the testbench you want to simulate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Generation

FlooNoC comes with a generation framework called `floogen`. It allows to create complex network configurations with a simple configuration file.

### Capabilities

`floogen` has a graph-based internal representation of the network configuration. This allows to easily add new features and capabilities to the generation framework. The following list shows the a couple of the current capabilities of `floogen`:

- **Validation**: The configuration is validated before the generation to ensure that the configuration is valid. For instance, the configuration is checked for invalid user input, overlapping address ranges
- **Routing**: XY-Routing and ID-Table routing are supported. `floogen` automatically generates the routing tables for the routers, as well as the address map for the network interfaces.
- **Package Generation**: `floogen` automatically generates a SystemVerilog package with all the needed types and constants for the network configuration.
- **Top Module Generation**: `floogen` automatically generates a top module that contains all router and network interfaces. The interfaces of the top module are AXI4 interfaces for all the enpdoints specified in the configuration.

### Example

The following example shows the configuration for a simple mesh topology with 4x4 routers and 4x4 chimneys with XY-Routing.

```yaml
  name: example_system
  description: "Example of a configuration file"

  routing:
    route_algo: "XY"
    use_id_table: true

  protocols:
    - name: "axi_in"
      type: "AXI4"
      data_width: 64
      addr_width: 32
      id_width: 3
      user_width: 1
    - name: "axi_out"
      type: "AXI4"
      data_width: 64
      addr_width: 32
      id_width: 3
      user_width: 1

  endpoints:
    - name: "cluster"
      array: [4, 4]
      addr_range:
        base: 0x1000_0000
        size: 0x0004_0000
      mgr_port_protocol:
        - "axi_in"
      sbr_port_protocol:
        - "axi_out"

  routers:
    - name: "router"
      array: [4, 4]

  connections:
    - src: "cluster"
      dst: "router"
      src_range:
      - [0, 3]
      - [0, 3]
      dst_range:
      - [0, 3]
      - [0, 3]
      bidirectional: true
```

### Usage

`floogen` can be installed and run _globally_ with `pip`, or _locally_ within a Python virtual environment.

##### Global installation

To install `floogen` run the following command:

```sh
pip install .
```

which allows you to use `floogen` with the following command:

```sh
floogen -c <config_file> -o <output_dir>
```

##### Local virtual environment
 
To build a local virtual environment we exploit `poetry`, that can be installed as follows:

```sh
pip install pipx==1.7.1
pipx install --suffix @main git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git@main
```

Note that the original setup leverages `Python 3.10` and `pipx 1.7.1`.
Moreover, we currently install the git development version of `poetry`, as [PEP 621 support has not been released yet](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/commit/119a3d761782e6ef1e6389a66d6d666906cd6e67) (see the [documentation](docs/floogen.md) for more details).

Then, to install `floogen` run the following script:

```sh
source floogen/floo_gen_venv.sh
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, `floogen` is executed with the following command:

```sh
floogen -c <config_file> -o <output_dir>
```

### Configuration

The example configuration above shows the basic structure of a configuration file. A more detailed description of the configuration file can be found in the [documentation](docs/floogen.md).
