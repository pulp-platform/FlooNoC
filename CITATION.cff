  This article introduces an open-source, low-latency
  Network-on-Chip (NoC) designed to tackle bandwidth
  challenges faced by traditional narrow and serialized
  NoCs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of wide
  channels by integrating a 5 Ã— 5 router and links within a
  9-core compute cluster using 12-nm FinFet technology.
